# Settings Page

By default the settings page contains a single boolean setting to track whether the app should be displayed with the Light or Dark theme.

You can add additional settings by following the instructions appropriate to the design pattern you are using:

[Code Behind](./settings-codebehind.md) [(or with VB.Net examples)](./settings-codebehind.vb.md)

[MVVM Basic](./settings-mvvmbasic.md) [(or with VB.Net examples)](./settings-mvvmbasic.vb.md)

[MVVM Light](./settings-mvvmlight.md) [(or with VB.Net examples)](./settings-mvvmlight.vb.md)
