# New Page/New Feature commands

The "New Page" and "New Feature" commands in the right-click menu allow you to generate a new item and integrate it with your project. 

## Steps
The feature is composed of two steps:

1. Generate the selected feature/page and its dependencies and showing you.
1. Integrate the changes in your project or to just output the changes and integrate manually.

## 3rd party libraries
If you're adding a template that depends on 3rd party libraries, please read our [strategy regarding updates](https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsTemplateStudio/wiki/3rd-party-libraries---updates-and-breaking-changes)

## Change summary page
See the following documentation to understand the different files shown on the changes summary page:

### Conflicting files

Files that were generated as part of the new feature/page but are already part of your project but are different.

This can happen for example if you add a settings storage feature, but already have a json.cs file in your project which is also generated as part of the feature.
The files will not be copied from the temporary generation folder to your project folder, but you have to review both files
(comparing the file from the temp generation folder to the file in your project), to see if everything is in the right place and adjust where necessary.

### Failed merges

To include the new feature/page WTS tried to modify files from your project, but could not do so.
For example when you add a new page to a project with navigation pane, there is a postaction that will add this page to the ShellViewModel. 

There are two possible reasons that could make this fail:

* The file was not found. Maybe you renamed it, or moved it to another folder. If this is the case, please locate the file and include the shown code blocks manually.
* The file was found, but has changed. In this case, please study the shown code blocks and see how to integrate them in your file.

### Modified files

Files that exist in your project and will be modified to include the feature/project.

### New files

New files generated by the feature/page added that are not available in your project.

### Unchanged files

Files that were generated as part of the new feature/page but are already part of your project. This can happen for example if you already added a settings storage feature and then add it another time. As the files are identical the files will not be copied and you do not have to take any action.
